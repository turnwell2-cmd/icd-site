Modernization performed. Key points:
- created includes/header.php and includes/footer.php
- created css/style.css (keeps blue/white scheme)
- converted top-level .php/.html to include header/footer with debug comments
- replaced Flash objects with placeholders (original .swf remains in /swf/)
- kept netlib.php if present and included it from header.php for compatibility
